  With respect to the new movie, <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, this project will use the social media platform, Twitter, as communication tool between Marvel superhero fans. 
  
  The motivation for this system is to provide a social media site where superhero fans can discuss with one another their beliefs and scenarios for and about their favorite Marvel superheroes. The user will be able to log into the system and add/delete messages, follow, unfollow other users and superheroes in a Twitter-like program.
